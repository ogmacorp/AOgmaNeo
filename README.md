## Introduction 

Welcome to the [Ogma](https://ogmacorp.com) AOgmaNeo library, C++ library that contains an implementation of Sparse Predictive Hierarchies aimed at desktop, embedded, and microcontroller devices.

This version of OgmaNeo (AOgmaNeo) is based on [OgmaNeo2](https://github.com/ogmacorp/OgmaNeo2), but stripped down in order to be able to run on an Arduino or similar microcontroller.

For an introduction to how the algorithm works, see [the presentation](https://github.com/ogmacorp/OgmaNeo2/blob/master/SPH_Presentation.pdf) (from the OgmaNeo2 repository).
For a more in-depth look, check out [the whitepaper](https://github.com/ogmacorp/OgmaNeo2/blob/master/OgmaNeo2_Whitepaper_DRAFT.pdf)  (from the OgmaNeo2 repository).

## Installation

Same as [OgmaNeo2](https://github.com/ogmacorp/OgmaNeo2) on desktop.

For Arduino, you will need to modify the source to fit your particular device. We have tested it on a Teensy 4.0 (using TeensyDuino) and on and Arduino Uno (very memory limited, 2kB).
